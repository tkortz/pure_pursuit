# Original Source

This Pure Pursuit implementation was originally part of https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics.

# Changes

This code has been updated to work with [LITMUS^RT](https://github.com/LITMUS-RT/litmus-rt) and the [Python liblitmus wrapper](https://github.com/tkortz/liblitmus-py), thus enabling it to run as a real-time task.
